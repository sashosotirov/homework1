> Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice in which developers merge their changes to the main branch many times per day. 
> Each merge triggers an **automated code build and test sequence**, which ideally runs in less than 10 minutes.

# Continuous Integration pipline stages: 

- automated code build
